Parameters were debugged and defined properly.
Function calcNewVelocity calculates the new velocity based on acceleration and time plus velocity. 
Input parameters are validated to ensure that all units are in the expected format.
Units are converted to a common unit system (meters and kilograms) for consistent calculations.
New distance is calculated based on the initial distance, velocity, and time.
The amount of remaining fuel is calculated by subtracting the fuel consumed over time.
Function calcNewVelocity calculates and convertes back to the original unit system (kilometers per hour).
The results are logged to the console, indicating the corrected new velocity, new distance, and remaining fuel.
